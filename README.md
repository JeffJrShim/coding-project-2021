# SMV Coding Project 2021
Hi, welcome to my little repository for my school project, don't expect any updates here, nor am I accepting any pull requests to fix my code, unless I have to for security or privacy issues. Other then that, I'm not accepting pull requests. 

Acknowledgements are in a seperate gist, located [here](https://gist.github.com/JeffJrShim/b51c1e92527a495aef1d756cbbc0c6b4/)

Till then, thanks for reading until here. Enjoy the website.
